## For the rights of workers in the game industry.

Game Workers Unite Montréal is a democratic organization dedicated to advocating for unions and for workers’ rights in the games industry. We are not a union, but aim to build one through the joint efforts of our members and other workers who would benefit from unionization.

Montréal is well-known as a major hub for the game industry in North America. Montréal is notable for the number of game companies it hosts – workers here are a powerful force. Together, we can achieve better working conditions and recognition for workers, in Montréal and across the globe.

## What do we do?

Stories of mass layoffs and abuse in the game industry are all too frequent. By organizing together, we aim to create support networks for game workers that focus on our rights and needs and improve working conditions. We provide organizer training and peer support to workers who are in difficult situations, share information about workers’ legal rights, and connect people with legal support, community organizations, and existing unions.

Members in GWU Montréal work together in committees to tackle different projects, whether it’s organizing a workplace or creating literature, designing and putting on workshops, or helping workers with individual complaints access the support that they need. We meet every month in a general assembly to share the latest developments.

## Building a better industry together.

The best way to change things for the better in our workplaces is through collective action. We believe that all workers have the power to contribute in building a more equitable industry. If you’re a game worker or a student planning to join the industry and are interested in working towards a better future, we invite you to join us. No previous organizing experience is required! Together, we can bring about meaningful change and fairer conditions for all workers in the industry.

# Zines and Resources

For GDC 2019, we wrote a zine talking about the recent layoffs in the industry, what needs to change, and giving tons of advice on how to organize and recognize union-busting methods deployed by our bosses. You can now download the revamped 2020 version here!

We recently co-organized a workshop with [Pixelles](https://pixelles.ca/) and [S'ATTAQ](http://sattaq.xyz/), during which we presented an introduction to Quebec labour law for employees, contractors, and freelancers in the game industry.
