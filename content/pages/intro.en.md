# Welcome!

We are the Montréal chapter of Game Workers Unite, a democratic organization of people dedicated to advocating for workers' rights in the games industry.

We're not a union, but we're working towards building one. Montréal is notable for the number of game companies it hosts – workers here are a powerful force. Together, we can achieve better working conditions, recognition, and mutual support.

Take a look at [the zine we distributed during GDC 2019](http://zines.gwumtl.com/) for information on recent layoffs and strikes, organizing tips, worker coops and more!

## Know your rights

We recently co-organized a workshop with [Pixelles](https://pixelles.ca/) and [S'ATTAQ](http://sattaq.xyz/), during which we presented an introduction to Quebec labour law for employees, contractors, and freelancers in the game industry.

You can now access the materials used for this workshop for future reference! Here are the [slides](kyr/KYR_Slides_EN.pdf) and the [pamphlet](kyr/KYR_Pamphlet_EN.pdf) in which you will find a handy summary of the topics we discussed.
