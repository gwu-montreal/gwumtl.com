      ## The games industry needs to change.

      Game Workers Unite Montréal is a democratic organization dedicated to advocating for unions and for workers’ rights in the games industry. GWU is not a union, but we’re working to help build them across the industry.

      Montréal is well-known as an international hub for the games industry, yet stories of mass layoffs and abuse are still rampant here. Enough is enough! Workers here are a powerful force — and through collaboration and mutual support we can achieve better working conditions and recognition for everyone.

      ## What do we do?

      Our main focus is on supporting workers who want to unionize their workplace. We provide training and peer support to workers who are in difficult situations, share information about workers’ legal rights, and connect people with legal support, community organizations, and existing unions.

      Our members also establish committees to tackle projects such as producing literature and organizing educational workshops. We meet monthly in a general assembly to share the latest developments.

      ## Building a better industry together.

      The best way to change conditions for workers is through collective action.

      If you work in the games industry — whether or not you’re currently employed — or you’re a student or are otherwise planning to join the industry, we invite you to join us. You don’t need any previous organizing experience, and we’re happy to provide organizer training.

      Together, we can build a better industry for **all of us**.
