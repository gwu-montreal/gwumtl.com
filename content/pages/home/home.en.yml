      Game Workers Unite Montréal is a democratic workers’ organization
      dedicated to advocating for workers’ rights and supporting union
      organizing in the games industry. GWU is not a union itself, but we’re
      working to help build them across the industry.


      \r

      Montréal is well-known as an international hub for the games
      industry, yet stories of mass layoffs and abuse are still rampant here.
      Enough is enough! Workers here are a powerful force — and through
      collaboration and mutual support we can achieve better working conditions
      and recognition for everyone.\r\n"

      Our main focus is on supporting workers who want to unionize their
      workplace. We provide training and peer support to workers who are in
      difficult situations, share information about workers’ legal rights, and
      connect people with legal support, community organizations, and existing
      unions and labour organizations.\r


      Our members also form committees to collaborate on projects such as
      producing literature and organizing educational workshops. We meet monthly
      in a general assembly to share the latest developments.\r\n"

      The best way to improve conditions for workers is through collective
      action.\r


      If you work in the games industry — whether or not you’re currently
      employed — or if you’re a student or are otherwise planning to join the
      industry, we invite you to join us. You don’t need any previous organizing
      experience, and we’re happy to provide organizer training.\r


      Together, we can build a better industry for **all of us**."
