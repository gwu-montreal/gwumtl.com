# What’s a worker cooperative ?

A worker cooperative is a kind of business model. In Québec and many places around the world it’s also a specific legal entity. Worker cooperatives can be for-profit or not-for-profit — the important aspect is that they are democratically run by their workers. This means that leadership is elected and that the business itself is owned by the people who work there. Each worker-owner (or member) has a single vote. A worker cooperative puts the needs of its workers first and its main purpose is to provide jobs to its members.

Worker ownership means that unlike other business models, there are no shareholders or external capitalists who own the company and passively earn profits from exploiting its activity. Workers have full ownership of what they produce — and the value they create after selling it remains theirs and theirs alone.

Worker cooperatives are managed by a set of core rules — its bylaws — that outline everything necessary to run the coop. Bylaws are written by the workers and might define, amongst other things, how surplus revenue is managed, how the board of directors is elected, and a code of conduct. These rules can be modified by voting during General Assemblies when a quorum is met.
